          Trump has tweeted that he personally created the greatest economy in history more than <Link to='/?searchbox=%22%5C%22greatest+economy%5C%22%22'>20 times</Link>.

        <Paragraph>
          Trump has not tweeted about how he inherited upward economic trends from previous administrations, that economies are relatively unrelated to presidential action, or that the greatest economic crash of all time happened on his watch.

          Trump is averaging 1.5% quarterly growth, and 2.5% quarterly growth pre-Coronavirus. His best quarter came in 2018 with 3.3% growth. He also oversaw the greatest contraction in history in 2020 with -9.5% growth.

          Obama averaged 1.6% quarterly growth, and 2.3% quarterly growth post-2008 Recession. His best quarter came in 2015 with 4.1% growth.

          Trump presided over a 1.5% drop in unemployment, following the trend of the Obama years (which saw a 5.3% drop), leading to the lowest unemployment numbers since 1954. Trump also presided over the highest unemployment rate in history in April 2020 (14.7%).

        <Paragraph>
          Trump is obviously not on track to get rid of the US government debt. Even before the COVID stimulus, there was no meaningful progress made on debt reduction.

        <Paragraph>
          Trump added $5.7 trillion to the debt in a little more than 3 years. Notably, he tweeted about debt <Link to='/?searchbox=%22debt%22&retweet=%5B%22Hide+Retweets%22%5D'>161 times</Link> during the Obama presidency, but only 16 times during his own presidency.

            "The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won - a Big Crash!"

        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Trump often claims that electing Democrats would crash the stock market, despite the fact that the Obama/Biden years saw a 140% increase. Trump has presided over accelerated stock market increases (especially in 2017), though there have been a number of erratic and precipitous drops, including the three largest single-day drops in history.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="conclusion">
          Trump taking credit for "the greatest economy in history" is a bit like being handed the baton at the last lap of a race with a big lead, only to stumble at the finish line because you thought the hurdles were fake news. The growth was inherited, and if he intends to take credit, he must also own the decline.
