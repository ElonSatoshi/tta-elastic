Themes:
- Downplay the seriousness
- Blame someone else - China, media, liberals
- Self-praise - ratings, best numbers
- Never say anything about the sick or dead
- Tout miracle shots (hydroxychloroquine, vaccines, summer weather) instead of masks and distancing
- Remember when - ventilators, closed the borders
- No national plan - just sit back and criticize governors (no national testing or school reopening)
